# light-field-raindrop-dataset

Light field raindrop dataset was collected with the first generation Lytro camera.
The dataset contains 90 light field raindrop images that cover different camera angles and scenes.
For each image, we provide the light field source file, reference image, and reference depth map given by the Lytro software.
The light field source file can be easily decoded by the light field toolbox (https://github.com/doda42/LFToolbox).

An example is shown Fig. 1:

We collected raindrop images with glass plate, window of train, and window of car.
The camera is placed 10 to 15 cm in front of the glass plate and windows.

The first 40 images (part1) in our dataset cover different situations evenly. 
The last 50 images (part2) are was collected with the UTBM robocar. The Lytro camera was held in the car by the author, and the corresponding GPS information was also recorded. As shown on the right side in the Fig. 2, the route of data collection is the same as the 
EU long-term dataset (https://epan-utbm.github.io/utbm_robocar_dataset/).
